<b>Open the test file</b> <br>
This option specifies where Squaretest should open the test file. <br/><br/>
<b>In the active editor window</b> <br>
Squaretest will always open the test file in the active editor window (the editor window <br>
containing the source class). <br><br>
<b>In the next editor window if one is available</b><br>
Squaretest will open the test file in the editor window next to the active editor window if one is available; <br>
otherwise, it will open the test file in the active editor window. <br><br>
<b>In the next editor window, creating one if needed</b><br>
Squaretest will open the test file in the editor window next to the active editor window if one is available; <br>
otherwise, it will create a new editor window by splitting the active editor window vertically and open the <br>
test file in the new window.
