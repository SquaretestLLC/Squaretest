<b>Data Constructor Limit When Bean Option Available</b> <br/>
Specifies the longest, nested constructor call (number of parameters) that will be used to initialize recognized data classes.<br/>
If the constructor call exceeds this limit Squaretest will use the zero-argument constructor and bean <br/>
setter methods to initialize the class, if one is available.<br/><br/>
<b>Recognized Data Classes</b><br/>
Squaretest considers a class to be a data class if it has at least one data annotation. <br/>
Examples include annotations with canonical names that start with "lombok",<br/>
"javax.xml.bind.annotation", etc.
